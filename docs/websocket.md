# Websocket

You can find a websocket endpoint where you can gather realtime data from LN Markets such as bid, offer, index and last price.

The websocket endpoint for mainnet is : `wss://api.lnmarkets.com/realtime`

You are limited to 60 connections per hour

Authentication to websocket will come soon !
